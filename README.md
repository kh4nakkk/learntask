Hello!! 

This Is Khanak Korotania!

Ive made this website to display my basic knowledge of JavaScript .

In just two weeks, I dove into JavaScript and learned the essentials of variables, data types, and operators. I explored loops and conditional statements, which allowed me to control the flow of programs. Functions became a key tool for organizing and reusing code efficiently. Arrays and objects helped me manage complex data.


Do await more to come!.
